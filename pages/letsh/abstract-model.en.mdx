# Abstract Model

## Introduction

While I was creating letsh application, I thought that there must be some data that could be <ins>shared</ins> throughout data no matter what they are.
The best example for this could be time that data was newly created or updated.
If I include these data, then admin users later will be able to easily control over those data based on those time data.

However, including all these common data into all other apps' models is just repeating codes ourselves and it could waste our DB.
So it would be very effective to make these types of models that <ins>**_do not wasting too much DB space and can be used in other models_**</ins>.

> Django is also suggesting [DRY(Do NOT Repeat Yourself)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry), so let's keep our code more sexier!

This is where [abstract model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/#abstract-base-classes) is used.
After I defined the common data fields, with [class inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
other apps' models can also use Common model's data fields.

<br />

## Coding

Firstly, I created new django-app called `common/` for our abstract common model in project root route.

```
django-admin startapp common
```

Then included in [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#installed-apps).

```python config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  # ...
  "common",
]
```

<br />

### `TimeStampModel`

`TimeStampModel` is abstract model that controls time.
Let's edit `models.py` file inside of `common/` app folder.

#### Creating model class

I created class named `TimeStampModel` that controls over time of data has been created/updated.

```python focus=3:7
from django.db import models

class TimeStampModel(models.Model):

    """TimeStamp Model Definition"""

    pass
```

---

#### `Meta` class configuration

[`Meta` class](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/#meta-options) allows us to do several configurations for our models.
As our `TimeStampModel` is abstract base model, I set `abstract = True` as explained in [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/#abstract-base-classes).

By doing this, we can use these fields in other models without creating DB table.

```python focus=9:10
from django.db import models

class TimeStampModel(models.Model):

    """TimeStamp Model Definition"""

    pass

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

---

#### `DateTimeField`

Finally, let's specify model field.

As you can literally tell from its name, [`DateTimeField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.DateTimeField)
controls date and time.
I created model field called `created_at` and `updated_at` for created time and updated time, respectively.

Meanwhile, [`auto_now_add`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.DateField.auto_now_add) attribute sets date and time as now
when new object is <ins>newly created</ins>.

On the other hand, [`auto_now`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.DateField.auto_now) attribute marks date and time as now
when the object is <ins>newly updated</ins>.

```python focus=7:8
from django.db import models

class TimeStampModel(models.Model):

    """TimeStamp Model Definition"""

    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

## Result

If we add field defined in abstract base model in other apps' `admin.py`,
we can see it is nicely put into admin panel as below.

<br />

But then if we take a look at `common/` app's database, we can find out that there has been no migration happened for `TimeStampModel` (See blue bracket).
By doing this, we can effectively manage database.
