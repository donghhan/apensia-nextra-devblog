<br />

It is web framework based on Python programming language.
Normally it is widely known as backend framework, but it can deal with frontend layer with providing templates separately, ~~which is an awesome boy~~.
There used to be a [skeptical point of view](https://www.projectpro.io/article/python-for-data-science-vs-python-for-web-development/177) that Python is NOT appropriate for web development,
but ever since Django came out of this world, people started to think differently.

Let us view what are [advantages](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) that Django documentation is mentioning.

### Astonishingly quick development speed

One of the biggest advantages that Django feels proud of itself is <ins>**quick development speed**</ins>, which is the reason why I like most too.
We can tell it from [the history of Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_web_framework#History), where web programmers made Django for meeting deadlines of their tasks while working newspaper company in the year of 2003.

Django has many different modules as lego blocks that implements a variety of features (such as authentication, admin page, forms, i18n, etc),
so whenever you are feel get used to using those tools, you can build up your application very quickly.

### Security

Django provides the [basic tools for enhancing web security](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/security/) (e.g. XSS, CSRF, etc).
Therefore, frontend/backend developers do not need to be sick and tired of thinking too much of security.

### Scaling

Django literally has very good position of [scaling up](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/faq/general/#does-django-scale).
As Django is using "shared-nothing" architecture and split all resources into apart except networks (i.e. it does not share anything), it allows us to add up whatever hardwares we would like to add with ease.

<br />

## Features

Then what are some featuers that Django has?

### ORM

Django supports ORM. [ORM(Object-Relational Mapping)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) in this case means converting data between type systems with using object-oriented programming language.
That is, _[it allows us to interact database](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/django-orm) even though we do not need to know how to build up SQL queries_.
~~Hooray! I don't need to learn SQL!!ðŸ¤­~~

<br />

### Design Pattern

[Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) indicates rule or project structure that can effectively makes us produce code which can solve many different problems on software design.

#### MVT Pattern

MVT pattern stands for <ins>**M**</ins>odel <ins>**V**</ins>iew <ins>**T**</ins>emplate.

1. Model: Manages database.
2. View: With interacting Model and Template, it manages the sending/receiving HTTP request/response, respectiveyl.
3. Template: Major frontend layer of Django application to show HTTP responses.

## Why I chose Django

The reasons why I chose Django as Let'sh's backend is as follows:

### Fast and Optimized CRUD development

[CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud) indicateds <ins>**C**</ins>reate / <ins>**R**</ins>ead / <ins>**U**</ins>pdate / <ins>**D**</ins>elete.
Whenever we make an API, it is generally recommended to make them according to their purposes, and the most commonly used ones are those four types.
As I already mentioned in [Astonishingly quick development speed](#astonishingly-quick-development-speed), Django already has basic tools that most of the websites might have,
so all we can do is just to take advantage of those modules appropriately. Indeed, I thought this would save huge time as long as I _properly use them_.
~~Of course I wasted too much time on debugging..ðŸ˜“~~

### Scaling Up

At first I aimed to serve accomodation booking service through Let'sh.
However, as I changed my mind to convert Let'sh into _share commerce platform specialized in Thailand_, I thought it would be better if I can enlarge service area not only for accomodations,
but also other services such as parking and transportations.
To do this, I believed that scaling up would not be evitable and Django itself had advantages of doing so.
