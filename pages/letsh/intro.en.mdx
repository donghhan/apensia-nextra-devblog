<br />

It is web framework based on Python programming language.
Normally it is widely known as backend framework, but it can deal with frontend layer with providing templates separately, ~~which is an awesome boy~~.
There used to be a [skeptical point of view](https://www.projectpro.io/article/python-for-data-science-vs-python-for-web-development/177) that Python is NOT appropriate for web development,
but ever since Django came out of this world, people started to think differently.

Let us view what are [advantages](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) that Django documentation is mentioning.

### Astonishingly quick development speed

One of the biggest advantages that Django feels proud of itself is <ins>**quick development speed**</ins>, which is the reason why I like most too.
We can tell it from [the history of Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_web_framework#History), where web programmers made Django for meeting deadlines of their tasks while working newspaper company in the year of 2003.

Django has many different modules as lego blocks that implements a variety of features (such as authentication, admin page, forms, i18n, etc),
so whenever you are feel get used to using those tools, you can build up your application very quickly.

### Security

Django provides the [basic tools for enhancing web security](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/security/) (e.g. XSS, CSRF, etc).
Therefore, frontend/backend developers do not need to be sick and tired of thinking too much of security.

### Scaling

Django literally has very good position of [scaling up](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/faq/general/#does-django-scale).
As Django is using "shared-nothing" architecture and split all resources into apart except networks (i.e. it does not share anything), it allows us to add up whatever hardwares we would like to add with ease.

## Features

Then what are some featuers that Django has?

### ORM

Django supports ORM. [ORM(Object-Relational Mapping)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) in this case means converting data between type systems with using object-oriented programming language.
That is, _[it allows us to interact database](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/django-orm) even though we do not need to know how to build up SQL queries_.
~~Hooray! I don't need to learn SQL!!ðŸ¤­~~

<br />

### Design Pattern

[Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) indicates rule or project structure that can effectively makes us produce code which can solve many different problems on software design.

#### MVT Pattern

MVT pattern stands for <ins>**M**</ins>odel <ins>**V**</ins>iew <ins>**T**</ins>emplate.

1. Model: Manages database.
2. View: With interacting Model and Template, it manages the sending/receiving HTTP request/response, respectiveyl.
3. Template: Major frontend layer of Django application to show HTTP responses.
