# With `relationMode = "prisma"`, no foreign keys are used, so relation fields will not benefit from the index usually created by the relational database under the hood.

## What I tried to do

I was trying to make `Token` model in Prisma for issuing token for registering new users.

## What I actually tried

### `User` model

```prisma
model User {
  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  firstName   String
  lastName    String
  email       String  @unique
  phoneNumber String
  Token       Token[]
}
```

### `Token` model

```prisma
model Token {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  payload   String    @unique
  user      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime? @updatedAt
  userId    Int
}
```

## Error that I got

It was not an error but there was warning sign on `@relation` part.

> With `relationMode = "prisma"`, no foreign keys are used, so relation fields will not benefit from the index usually created by the relational database under the hood. This can lead to poor performance when querying these fields. We recommend adding an index manually. Learn more at https://pris.ly/d/relation-mode-prisma-indexes"

## Analysis

According to the [official documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/relation-mode#indexes) of Prisma Client,
as relational database uses foreign key constraint it implicitly creates foreign key column so as to quickly check data without table scan separately.

On the other hand, `prisma` relation does not use foreign key constraint, and thus indexes are created after making migration to DB.
Therefore, we need to add foreign key field manually.

### Before

I edited the previous `Token` model

```prisma
model Token {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  payload   String    @unique
  user      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime? @updatedAt
  userId    Int
}
```

---

### After

with adding [`@@index`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#index) and included index
as documentation suggested.

```prisma focus=9
model Token {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  payload   String    @unique
  userId    Int
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime? @updatedAt
  User      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  @@index([userId])
}
```
