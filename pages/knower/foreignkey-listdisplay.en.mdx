# Showing Customer Information With Order

## Introduction

In order that admin users can effectively control customers' orders, I decided to show some customers' information attached to the order that they created.

## Analysis

In Django, we can show model fields with [`list_display`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display).
For relationship fields such as [`ForeignKey`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey) or [`ManyToManyField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField), however, are different story.

1. `ForeignKey` will explicitly show the value that `__str__()` method returns.
2. `ManyToManyField` is not supported since it makes Django to carry out different SQL commands on each rows of table which is quite costly.

> As of Feburary 6th, 2024, we can use `__` lookups in dev version, but still not in 5.0 version.

I implemented this feature by creating extra methods with [`display` decorator](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#the-display-decorator).

## Solution

### Creating `OrderAdmin` class

Connecting `Order` model with `OrderAdmin` class with [`register` decorator](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#the-register-decorator).

```py admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import *

@admin.register(Order)
class OrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = []
```

---

### Creating method for customer name

I created `get_customer_full_name()` method with using `display` decorator that returns the full name of customers.
The second parameter `obj` indicates the queryset of `Order` connected to `OrderAdmin`, and I `return`ed `first_name` and `last_name` of `user` that is connected with `ForeignKey`.

Then, I put it into `list_display` array.

```py admin.py focus=5,9:11
@admin.register(Order)
class OrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = [
        "order_number",
        "get_customer_full_name",
        "created_at",
    ]

    @admin.display(description="고객명")
    def get_customer_full_name(self, obj):
        return f"{obj.user.last_name} {obj.user.first_name}"
```

---

### Creating customer contact info

I did same thing over again for customers' contact info and put it in `list_display`.

```py admin.py focus=15:21
@admin.register(Order)
class OrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = [
        "order_number",
        "get_customer_full_name",
        "get_customer_mobile_number",
        "get_customer_email",
        "created_at",
    ]

    @admin.display(description="고객명")
    def get_customer_full_name(self, obj):
        return f"{obj.user.last_name} {obj.user.first_name}"

    @admin.display(description="고객 연락처")
    def get_customer_mobile_number(self, obj):
        return obj.user.mobile_number

    @admin.display(description="고객 이메일")
    def get_customer_email(self, obj):
        return obj.user.email
```
