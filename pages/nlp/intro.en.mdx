## Importance

According to the IDC's record, [about 80% of worldwide data will be unstructured data by the year of 2025](https://solutionsreview.com/data-management/80-percent-of-your-data-will-be-unstructured-in-five-years/).

> ### Structured Data & Unstructured Data
>
> Structured data indicate data that has been structured by predetermined models. Examples are Excel and RDMS.
> On the other hand, unstructured data indicate data that has its own inner structure but not structred by predetermined data models. Examples are normal text files, email, SNS and websites.

Also as paradigm of conversation between humans and computers are moving toward to conversation-based interface, the way human beings talk to computers began to change into much more natural way.
