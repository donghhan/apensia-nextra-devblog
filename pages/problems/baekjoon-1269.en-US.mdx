# BOJ #1269

## Question

Given the two sets A and B that are not empty sets with positive integers, find the length of both sets' symmetric differences.
Symmetric difference is an union of (A-B) and (B-A)

For instance, if A = { 1, 2, 4 } and B = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }, A-B = { 1 } and B-A = { 3, 5, 6 }. So therefore, 1 + 3 = 4.

<br/>

## Input and Output

Number of elements for each set A and set B is given on the first line with space between.
On the second line and the third line, number of all elements for set A and set B are given, respectively.
Number of elements for each sets does not exceed more than 200,000 and all element values do not exceed more than 100,000,000.

<CH.Code>

```bash input
3 5
1 2 4
2 3 4 5 6
```

```bash output
4
```

## Solution

It was pretty much basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)" target="_blank">difference</a> problem in mathematics.

<br/>

### JavaScript

#### Fail Case 1

I thought of simply using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter" target="_blank"><code>.filter()</code></a>
to get differences of set A and set B altogether.

```js
const input = require("fs")
  .readFileSync(0)
  .toString()
  .trim()
  .split("\n");

const [length, ...nums] = input;
const numA = +length.split(" ")[0]; // Input of number of elements for set A
const numB = +length.split(" ")[1]; // Input of number of elements for set B
const A = nums[0].split(" "); // set A
const B = nums[1].split(" "); // set B

// Getting difference for set A
const onlyA = A.filter((el) => !B.includes(el));
// and vice versa
const onlyB = B.filter((el) => !A.includes(el));

console.log(onlyA.length + onlyB.length); // Adding up number of differences for each sets
```

<br/>

But then I confronted time exceed problem.
This might because as the number of elements each sets can have could be maximum 200,000.
As `.filter()` requires linear time complexity of $O(n)$, my logic above seemed to be not proper at all when it comes to time complexity.

<br/>

#### Success

I decided to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" target="_blank"><code>Set()</code></a> which has better performance.

1. First of all, put all elements for both set A and set B in `Set()`.
2. After then, follow exactly as same logic that I tried above and put the results in `Set()` again.
   - We can identify whether the element is inside of `Set()` using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/has" target="_blank"><code>.has()</code></a> method.

```js
const input = require("fs")
  .readFileSync(0)
  .toString()
  .trim()
  .split("\n");

const [length, ...nums] = input;
const numA = +length.split(" ")[0];
const numB = +length.split(" ")[1];
// Putting all elements in Sets
const A = new Set(nums[0].split(" ").map(Number));
const B = new Set(nums[1].split(" ").map(Number));

const onlyA = new Set([...A].filter((el) => !B.has(el)));
const onlyB = new Set([...B].filter((el) => !A.has(el)));
console.log([...onlyA].length + [...onlyB].length);
```

## Other Solutions

  <p>
    We could also use intersection and calculate back the symmetric difference. 
    After putting all elements in set B, check all elements for set A if they are within set B. If so, increase the count of intersection by 1. 
    Then, add up set A's size of `N` and set B's size of `M` and subtract the intersection size.

    But this case would only work if set A size is always smaller than set B size, so it would be better to edit furthermore.

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>

    ```js
    const input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf-8').trim().split('\n');

    const [ N, M ] = input[0].split(' ').map(Number);
    const a = input[1].split(' ');
    const b = new Set([...input[2].split(' ')]);

    let kyoCnt = 0;
    for (let i=0; i<N; i++) {
        if (b.has(a[i])) kyoCnt++;
    }

    console.log(N + M - (2 * kyoCnt));
    ```
