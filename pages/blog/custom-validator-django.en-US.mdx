# Django password validator

Django provides the awesome built-in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/passwords/#module-django.contrib.auth.password_validation" target="_blank">password validator</a>
that can be applied throughout the whole page by the time you initiate Django project.

However, we might sometimes want to change Django's built-in password validators as they are too much or not necessary.

## Project initialization

### Creating virtual environment

In order to start project, we will create project folder called `password-validator`.

```bash
mkdir password-validator
cd password-validator
```

<br/>

Next, we wil set up the virutal environment with using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/" target="_blank">pipenv</a> package.

```bash
pipenv --three
```

Finally, we will activate the virutal environment.

```bash
pipenv shell
```

<br/>

We will install Django with version of 4.0.0.

```bash
pipenv install django
```

> Make sure you always activate the virtual environment before installing Django!
> If you would like to deactivate the virtual environment, you can simply type `deactivate` on the command console.[^1]

If you successfully installed Django, Django will automatically create `Pipfile` file with contenst below for you.

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
django = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

<br/>

### Creating Django App

In the console, run the following command with virutal environment being up.

```bash
django-admin startproject config .
```

This command allows us to create Django project name `config` within `password-validator` folder.

If you go to `settings.py` file, you will be able to see the Django's built-in password validators in `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`.
