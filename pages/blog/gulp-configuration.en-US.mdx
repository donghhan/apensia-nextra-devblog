# Playing with Gulp

## What is Gulp?

<a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> is an automated task runner based on NodeJS and NPM.
In this context, what do we mean by "tasks" indicate a series of JavaScript functions that are executed by the time they are called such as compiling SASS/SCSS into CSS, compiling TypeScript into JavaScript and so on.

### Difference between Webpack and Gulp

This will lead us to the question: Then what is the difference between Webpack and Gulp?

I created the table that shows the difference between Webpack and Gulp.[^1]

|                          |                                 Webpack                                 |                                        Gulp                                         |
| :----------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Definition        | Module Bundler that combines different files into one consolidated file | Automated task runner that carries out the different types of tasks simultaneously. |
| Configuration Difficulty |                                  Hard                                   |                                        Easy                                         |
|      Code required       |                                  More                                   |                                        Less                                         |
|     Appropriate for      |               Application with multiple complex processes               |               Simple application that does not take too much memories               |

## Setup for Gulp

Let's go over each section one by one.

### Installing Gulp

We will installing the <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start#install-the-gulp-command-line-utility" target="_blank">gulp-cli</a> first.

```bash
npm i -g gulp-cli
```

<br/>

Next, inside the project folder, we will create `package.json` file with the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command will allow you to create `package.json` file automatically <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init#yes" target="_blank">with answering all questions "yes"</a>.

<br/>

Then, we will <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start#install-the-gulp-package-in-your-devdependencies" target="_blank">install Gulp</a>.

```bash
npm i -D gulp

#or

yarn add -D gulp
```

<br/>

### Creating `gulpfile.js`

<a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#gulpfile-explained" target="_blank"><code>gulpfile.js</code></a> is pretty much Gulp's configuration file where we can define all tasks that we desire.

```bash
# For MAC/Linux users
touch gulpfile.js

# For Windows users
echo.> gulpfile.js
```

#### Connecting with Babel

In order to use `gulpfile.js` with JavaScript ES6 version, we would need to use <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a>
