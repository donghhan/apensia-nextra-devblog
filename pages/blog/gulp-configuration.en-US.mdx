# Playing with Gulp

## What is Gulp?

<a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> is an automated task runner based on NodeJS and NPM.
In this context, what do we mean by "tasks" indicate a series of JavaScript functions that are executed by the time they are called such as compiling SASS/SCSS into CSS, compiling TypeScript into JavaScript and so on.

### Difference between Webpack and Gulp

This will lead us to the question: Then what is the difference between Webpack and Gulp?

I created the table that shows the difference between Webpack and Gulp.[^1]

|                          |                                 Webpack                                 |                                        Gulp                                         |
| :----------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Definition        | Module Bundler that combines different files into one consolidated file | Automated task runner that carries out the different types of tasks simultaneously. |

## Setup for Gulp

Let's go over each section one by one.

### Installing Gulp

We will installing the <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start#install-the-gulp-command-line-utility" target="_blank">gulp-cli</a> first.

```bash
npm i -g gulp-cli
```

<br/>

Next, inside the project folder, we will create `package.json` file with the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command will allow you to create `package.json` file automatically <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init#yes" target="_blank">with answering all questions "yes"</a>.

<br/>

Then, we will <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start#install-the-gulp-package-in-your-devdependencies" target="_blank">install Gulp</a>.

```bash
# Using NPM
npm i -D gulp

# Using yarn
yarn add -D gulp
```

<br/>

### Creating `gulpfile.js`

<a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#gulpfile-explained" target="_blank"><code>gulpfile.js</code></a> is a Gulp's configuration file where we can define all tasks that we desire.

```bash
# For MAC/Linux users
touch gulpfile.js

# For Windows users
echo.> gulpfile.js
```

#### Using with Babel (Optional)

In order to use `gulpfile.js` with JavaScript ES6 version, we would need to use <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a>, which converts modern version JavaScript into an older version so that old browser could also understand the code.

To do so, we will firstly rename `gulpfile.js` into `gulpfile.babel.js`.

Next, we will install additional packages.

```bash
# Using NPM
npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env

# Using yarn
yarn add -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Then, we will create `babel.config.json` in the project root and include the following code.
By doing this, we can set up the `@babel/preset-env` and use it for our project.

```json babel.config.json
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

So far, our folder structure will look as below:

<br/>

<center>![folder_structure](../../media/gulp-configuration/gulp_folder_structure.png)</center>

<br/>

### Including `scripts` command on `package.json`

Inside of our `package.json` file, we will include two `scripts` commands:

1. `dev`: This is for development
2. `build`: This is for build

```json package.json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "gulp dev",
    "build": "gulp build"
}
```

<br/>

### Dividing folder structure

We will put all files that are to be compiled within `src/` folder.

```bash
mkdir src/
```

<hr/>

## Converting Pug into HTML

<a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Pug</a> is a template engine for NodeJS. We will be converting Pug into HTML files.

### Installing package

For converting Pug files into normal HTML files, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/gulp-community/gulp-pug#readme" target="_blank">gulp-pug</a> package.

```bash
# NPM
npm i -D gulp-pug

# yarn
yarn add -D gulp-pug
```

<br/>

### Importing

Let's import some necessary items from packges.

```js gulpfile.js focus=1:6
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const pug = require('gulp-pug');

// If you are using Babel with Gulp
// import { src, dest } from 'gulp';
// import pug from 'gulp-pug';

const routes = {
    pug: {
        src: "src/**/*.pug",
        build: "build"
    }
}

function PugIntoHTML() {
    return null;
}
```

---

### Routes

I created object called `routes`, which specifies the routes for each files that are in development and files that will be sent to build folder.

```js gulpfile.js focus=8:13
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const pug = require('gulp-pug');

// If you are using Babel with Gulp
// import { src, dest } from 'gulp';
// import pug from 'gulp-pug';

const routes = {
    pug: {
        src: "src/**/*.pug",
        build: "build"
    }
}

function PugIntoHTML() {
    return null;
}
```

---

### Defining task

Let's create a task for converting Pug files into HTML files.
I named it as `PugIntoHTML()`.

> Beginning from Gulp version, it is recommended to make task as a function instead of using `gulp.task`.

```js gulpfile.js focus=15:18
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const pug = require('gulp-pug');

// If you are using Babel with Gulp
// import { src, dest } from 'gulp';
// import pug from 'gulp-pug';

const routes = {
    pug: {
        src: "src/**/*.pug",
        build: "build"
    }
}

function PugIntoHTML() {
    return null;
}
```

---

#### Editing task

1. First, I need to let `PugIntoHTML()` task look for the files that are to be converted in `src/` file with using <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/api/src" target="_blank"><code>src()</code></a> method.
2. With using `pipe()`, I connected to the next task with `pug()` method from `gulp-pug` package.
3. Lastly, I designated routes for build files with using <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/api/dest" target="_blank"><code>dest()</code></a>

```js gulpfile.js focus=15:18
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const pug = require('gulp-pug');

// If you are using Babel with Gulp
// import { src, dest } from 'gulp';
// import pug from 'gulp-pug';

const routes = {
    pug: {
        src: "src/**/*.pug",
        build: "build"
    }
}

function PugIntoHTML() {
    return src(routes.pug.src)
        .pipe(pug())
        .pipe(dest(routes.pug.build));
}
```
