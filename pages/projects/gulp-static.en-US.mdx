# gulp-static

`gulp-static` is my personal project of the static website built by myself.

<br/>

## Introduction

This project is static website builder project with using Gulp.[^1]

## Epilogue

There are two things that I aimed to achieve for this first personal project.

1. Task automization with Gulp
2. Practice for responsive design

### Problems that I tried to solve

Honestly, I could have just used vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for making simple static website or use <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> library.
This is because I felt much more comfortable with using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> than CSS and as I have been also been in love-hate(?) relationship with TypeScript for a long time (although it won't be too different from JavaScript)...

However, as SCSS and TypeScript are not directly rendered in our browser, I had no choice but to compile them into browser-readable CSS and vanilla JavaScript code, which sounded cumbersome to me.

<a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/#usage" target="_blank">Compiling SCSS</a> or 
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html" target="_blank">compiling TypeScript</a> should rely on external NPM packages and configuring these commands were definitely not easy one. 
<ins>***Therefore, I needed to think of practical solution for automating these tasks.***</ins>

#### But Why Gulp?

When it comes to building tools, we often think of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>[^2], which made me think of use Webpack at first. But here's why I ended up choosing Gulp:

1. <ins>*Simplicity*</ins>: Configuration was super easy, which led to less lines of code compared to Webpack. Syntax was also simple enough that I could write a code intuitively referring to official documentation.
2. <ins>*Performance*</ins>: As all tasks are managed by in-memory format, I could expect faster and more efficient performance, especially for single application.

[^2]:
    <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/react-scripts/scripts" target="_blank">react-scripts</a> within <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> is also using Webpack.

#### Evaluation on Gulp

It was quite fascinating. Although better performance was not an option for building such simple static website to consider, Gulp was attractive in terms of 1) being able to manage multiple tasks simultaneously and most of all, 2) simplicity.
However, I thought Gulp won't be the best choice for application that has a number of multiple processes.

<br/>

### What I felt

Honestly the only thing that I felt difficult was to which Gulp plugin to choose. Other than that, nothing bothered me.
I also thought of that maybe it would be better if I can make task for optimizing video files.

Responsive is quite hard as always. Normally I split up into three different breakpoints as Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.
Depending on UI design, however, it is not always easy to split up exactly into three breakpoints only.
This made me think twice about how to effectively manage these breakpoints variables so as to meet what UI designers want in the future.
