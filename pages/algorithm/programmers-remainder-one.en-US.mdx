# Finding a number whose remainder is 1

## Question

Given a positive integer of `n`, complete solution function that `return`s a minimum value of `x` where remainder of `n` divided by `x` equals to 1.
It can be proved that there is always an answer.

## Condition

3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1,000,000

## Input & Output Example

<br/>

<center>
| Input | Output |
| ---- | ---- |
| 10   | 3    |
| 12   | 11   |
</center>

1. 10 divided by 3 will give us remainder of 1, and as there is no further positive integer smaller than 1, it should return 3.
2. 12 divided by 11 will give us remainder of 1, and as there is no further positive integer smaller than 11, it should return 11.

## Solution

I used quite basic solution. I put all `x` in an array beginning from 2 to `n` (except 1).
By the time numbers are input in order, I can just `return` the first value of the array.

<br/>

### Python

```py
answer = []

for i in range(n):
    if n % (i + 1) == 1:
        answer.append(i + 1)

return answer[0]
```

<br/>

### JavaScript

```js
const arr = [];

for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 1) {
        arr.push(i);
    }
}

return arr[0];
```

## Other Solutions

  <p>
    Using `while` statement, keep adding up 1 to `answer` until `n` is divided by `x`
    As we can simply need to return the smallest value, if we meet the condition within `while` statement, iteration will automatically stop and return the desired value.

    ```py
    def solution(n):
        return [x for x in range(1,n+1) if n%x==1][0]
    ```

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>

    ```js
    const answer = 1;
    while (n % answer !== 1) answer++;
    return answer;
    ```
