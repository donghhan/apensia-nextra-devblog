# Installation

## Virtual Environment

The first thing we need to do before initializing project with python is to set up virutal environment.
**Virtual Environment** indicates <ins>_the independent environment that is isolated from currently installed Python environment_</ins>.
In other words, we are basically setting individual Python development environment per each projects independently.

Why would we need to do this? We need to install many packages while doing projects and if those packages have their own dependencies,
an error would occur if package versions are different.
Moreover, error can also occur when package versions collide with each other after upgrading or installing packages.
In order to effectively control over these cumbersome things, it is recommended to set up virtual environment.

## Installing with Virtual Environment

### Pipenv

Pipenv is a combination of word of pip which is Python package managing tool and virtualenv which helps to create virtual environment.

Let's install Pipenv first.

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Next, install necessary packages with using `pipenv` keyword. Before install packages, make sure you install packages under the project root folder.

```bash
mkdir django-project
cd django-project
pipenv install django
```

### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is another Python package manage tool.

    Install Poetry with curl.
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_HOME=/etc/poetry python3 -
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    If you are using Powershell, 
    ```bash
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    ```

    Then, add environment variable in Advanced System Settings in Windows.

    Install Poetry with curl. 
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_HOME=/etc/poetry python3 -
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, navigate to project root folder and create `.lock` file with the following command.

```bash
mkdir django-project
cd django-project
poetry init
```

And we can install Django now.

```bash
poetry add django
```
