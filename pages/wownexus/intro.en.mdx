# Introduction

Wownexus is a web service that provides useful information of online MMORPG game [World of Warcraft: Classic](https://wowclassic.blizzard.com/en-us/).

## Why I started this project

1. Providing insufficient information for Classic: I felt like there were only few information available about raid dungeon of Classic, and thus I wanted to provide visualized information.
2. Easy gathering raid members: Unless using Discord app, gathering raid members done by in-game chat is quite time-consuming. So I wanted to provide utility features.
3. Putting other utility features in one place: Wanted to gather any other useful features available from outside such as controlling over dungeon rules.

[^1]: Indicating dungeon that is almost impossible for individual to complete so need to be cleared by multiple people (more than 6)
