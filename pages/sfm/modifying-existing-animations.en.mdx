# Modifying Existing Animations

Let's edit existing animations created by recording, sequence or animation with graph editor.

![initial](../../media/sfm/modifying-existing-animations/initial.png)

For example, if we set bookmark at certain point of animation for modifying,

<br />

<center>
  ![before](../../media/sfm/modifying-existing-animations/before.png)
</center>

<br />

animation curve becomes flattened before bookmark.

<br />

<center>
  ![after](../../media/sfm/modifying-existing-animations/after.png)
</center>

<br />

This breaks our existing animation, turning into loose animation.

## Toggle Offset Mode

The reason why this happens is because offset is NOT included in our existing animation.
To fix this, let's turn on the Toggle offset mode.

<br />

<center>
  ![toggle_offset_mode](../../media/sfm/modifying-existing-animations/toggle_offset_mode.png)
</center>

<br />

By doing this, every time we set bookmark, it won't break the original existing animation by adding offset.
