# Introduction

## What is Letha?

Letha is a community-based platform service where users can easily search and enjoy Thailand's wellness tourism programs.

## How Letha is started?

There are several problems that I found that Thailand wellness tourism industry has these days.

1. For those who are not familiar with Thailand do not even know where to start to enjoy wellness tourism programs.
2. Tourists are often exposed to the danger during tour (e.g. scams, accidents, etc)
3. It is quite time-consuming for searching wellness tourism programs and those programs' quality are not guaranteed addEmitHelper.

Letha was born in order to solve problems stated above.
