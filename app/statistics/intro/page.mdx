# Introduction

## Population & Sample

1. _Population_ indicates the whole or entire group of data information that is to be analyzed.
2. _Sample_ indicates <u>specific group</u> of data from which you collect.

As it is difficult to gather data from the whole population, we normally randomly collect data from sample and **infer** the population using sample data.
Therefore, sample is always less than population.

## Hypotheses

_Hypothesis_ in statistics indicates the method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample data to draw conclusions about a population.
Building appropriate hypothesis is critical in terms of

1. choosing the appropriate research framework,
2. allowing researchers to formulate testable predictions,
3. designing studies effectively,
4. and draw meaningful conclusions about populations based on sample data.

### Null Hypothesis

**Null hypothesis** (which is often noted as $H_0$) indicates hypothesis that <u>there is no difference between groups or no relationship between variables.</u>
In other words, null hypothesis is the statement that

### Alternative Hypothesis

**Alternative hypothesis** (which is often noted as $H_1$) refers to statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis.
