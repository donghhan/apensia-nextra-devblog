# Custom permission into generic views

## Introduction

I was writing a test code for testing `DeleteAccountView` that is built with [`DestoryAPIView`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#destroyapiview).
To be specific, I was testing if another user tried to delete account of owner's account, it will throw [403 Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/403) error.
In order to do this, I created custom permission called `IsOwnerOrAdmin` and connected to my view.

### Relevant codes

#### `permissions.py`

<br />

```py
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, SAFE_METHODS


class IsOwnerOrAdmin(BasePermission):
    message = "Forbidden"

    def has_permission(self, request, view) -> bool:
        return request.user.is_authenticated

    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        return obj.id == request.user.id or request.user.is_admin

```

<br />

#### `views.py`

<br />

```py
from rest_framework import generics

class DeleteAccountView(generics.DestroyAPIView):
    """
    Delete user account
    - Only owner and admin can delete user's account
    """

    permission_classes = [IsOwnerOrAdmin]
    serializer_class = PublicUserSerializer

    def get_object(self, id=None):
        user_to_delete = User.objects.get(id=self.kwargs.get("id"))
        return user_to_delete
```

<br />

#### `tests/views.py`

<br />

```py
# Omitted
def test_permission(self):
    """
    Test permission
    """
    # Fail case: anonymous user
    # Omitted

    # Fail case: another user
    self.auth.set_client_credentials(self.client, self.another_user)
    wrong_response_two = self.client.delete(
        self.get_delete_account_api_uri(self.user.id)
    )
    self.assertEqual(wrong_response_two.status_code, 403)
    self.assertEqual(wrong_response_two.data["detail"].code, "permission_denied")
```

## Problem

Test code was actually passing 204 status code, which is not correct.

## Analysis

`DetailAccountView` was not properly checking object-level permissions.

According to [Abdul Aziz Barkat's response from Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67147440/13121145) and [note](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#custom-permissions) from DRF's documentation about custom permission,
when using generic views with object-level permissions, I should have ensured that `get_object()` triggers the object-level checks.

However, overriding `get_object()` method caused bypassing DRF's permission checking mechanism, which means `check_object_permissions` method was not called.

## Solution

I followed what DRF suggested on its [Object level permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#object-level-permissions) wrote down.

I switched from generic views to viewset as I didn't need to worry about manually triggering object-level permission because [`ViewSet`](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/c41314f1fc898490f27e1015cc859e28afe6f7b9/rest_framework/viewsets.py#L220) class already handles this properly out of the box.
Also I used `lookup_field` and `lookup_url_kwarg` to tell DRF how to find object and removed `get_object()` method.

### `views.py`

```py
class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PublicUserSerializer
    lookup_field = "id"

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action in ["list", "retrieve", "create"]:
            permission_classes = [AllowAny]
        else:
            permission_classes = [IsOwnerOrAdmin]
        return [permission() for permission in permission_classes]
```
