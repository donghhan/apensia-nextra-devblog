# Flex

## `flex-grow`

[`flex-grow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) is a CSS property that allows the flex items to grow to specific amount inside of the parent container.
Let's say we have the code example below.

<br />

<CodeWithTabs>

```html !!tabs index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="box one"><span>One</span></div>
      <div class="box two"><span>Two</span></div>
      <div class="box three"><span>Three</span></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css !!tabs styles.css
body {
  height: 80vh;
  display: flex;
  background-color: gray;
}

.container {
  width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 1.5px solid black;
  background-color: lightgray;
  display: flex;
}

.box {
  display: flex;
  width: 90px;
  height: 60px;
}

.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
}

.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: aqua;
}

.box:nth-of-type(3) {
  background-color: green;
}

.box span {
  margin: auto;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

</CodeWithTabs>

<br />

<Initial />

<br />

The initial value of `flex-grow` of elements is set to `0`, which means each flex items cannot grow its value.
As we have not given any `flex-grow` value for `.box` element yet, `.box` elements keep their width same (`200px`).

Now, let's give `flex-grow` value to `1` to the first element and see what happens.

<br />

```css style.css
.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

<br />

<FlexGrowFirst />

<br />

As you can see from above, `.box` element of **One** occupied all of the free space whereas **Two** and **Three** `.box` elements still remained same,
as we haven't given any `flex-grow` value.

From here, we can think of `flex-grow` as a <u>**_fraction_**</u>. In other words, element with `flex-grow` value will take <u>`n` fraction or slice of free space</u>.

Now, let's give `flex-grow` value of `1` to **Two** element also and see what happens.

<br />

```css style.css
.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: aqua;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

<br />

<FlexGrowSecond />

<br />

This time, **One** element and **Two** element are both sharing the same free space and they took as same proportion of remaining free space while **Three** element still remained same.
Likewise, if we give `flex-grow` value for **One**, **Two** and **Three** as `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively, this means:

1. **One** element will take **1** fraction of free space (1/6).
2. **Two** element will take **2** fractions of free space (2/6).
3. **Three** element will take **3** fractions of free space (3/6).

<br />

```css style.css
.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: aqua;
  /* !diff - */
  flex-grow: 1;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-grow: 2;
}

.box:nth-of-type(3) {
  background-color: green;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-grow: 3;
}
```

<br />

Which will end up showing as below:

<br />

<FlexGrowThird />

## `flex-shrink`

On the other hand, `flex-shrink` is a CSS property to allow child flex elements to be **shrinked**.

Let's take another example code below.

<br />

<CodeWithTabs>

```html !!tabs index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="box one"><span>One</span></div>
      <div class="box two"><span>Two</span></div>
      <div class="box three"><span>Three</span></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css !!tabs styles.css
body {
  height: 80vh;
  display: flex;
  background-color: gray;
}

.container {
  width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 1.5px solid black;
  background-color: lightgray;
  display: flex;
}

.box {
  display: flex;
  width: 200px;
  height: 60px;
}

.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
}

.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: aqua;
}

.box:nth-of-type(3) {
  background-color: green;
}

.box span {
  margin: auto;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

</CodeWithTabs>

<br />

<FlexShrinkInitial />

<br />

Unlike the `flex-grow` example, this time each `.box` elements' width are increased to `200px` (from `90px`) which exceeds the `.container` total width of `600px`.
If we give `flex-shrink` value to `0` to the all `.box` elements, this means we are not allowing any `.box` elements to be shrinked whatsoever.

<br />

```css style.css
.box {
  display: flex;
  width: 200px;
  height: 60px;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

<br />

<FlexShrinkFirst />

<br />

The default value of `flex-shrink` is set to `1`, which means all child flex elements can be shrinked based on the width of the parent's element.

Now, let's give `flex-shrink` value of `2` to the **Three** `.box` element and see what happens.

<br />

<br />

```css style.css
.box {
  display: flex;
  width: 200px;
  height: 60px;
  /* !diff - */
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

.box:nth-of-type(3) {
  display: flex;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-shrink: 2;
}
```

<br />

<FlexShrinkSecond />

<br />

It seems there weren't any significant differences but if you take a look when shrink your browser window horizontally,
you will notice that **Three** element will shrink twich as much as **One** and **Two** elements do.

If you give `flex-shrink` value of `3` to **Two** element as below. That means **Two** element will shrink as third times as it do compared to the **One** element whose `flex-shrink` value is set to `1`.

<br />

```css style.css
.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  display: flex;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-shrink: 3;
}
```

<br />

<FlexShrinkThird />

## `flex-basis`

[`flex-basis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis) CSS property determines the initial starting size of flex child item before `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink` works.

We will be using the same example we used at the `flex-grow` section earlier.

<br />

<Initial />

<br />

The default `flex-basis` value is set to `auto`, which means child flex items will follow the initial `width` that we gave.
If `width` of element is not given, then child flex item will have `width` as wide as the inner content has.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `auto` value could be written as `content` as well but not widely supported
  for many browsers.
</Callout>

<br />

<FlexBasisFirst />

<br />

Now, let's take a look what happens if we give different CSS `flex-basis` value for each boxes,
which means `50px` for **One**, `100px` for **Two**, `150px` for **Three**, respectively.

<br />

```css
.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-basis: 50px;
}

.box:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: aqua;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-basis: 100px;
}

.box:nth-of-type(3) {
  background-color: green;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-basis: 150px;
}
```

<br />

<FlexBasisSecond />

<br />

As you can see, each boxes now has minimum `width` as we specified in `flex-basis`.

### Mixing `flex-basis` and `flex-grow`

Let's give another example. This time, we will

1. Give `flex-basis` for **One** element as `300px`.
2. Give `flex-grow` of `1` for all `.box` elements with each elements' size of `200px`.

and see what will happen.

<br />

```css
.box {
  display: flex;
  height: 60px;
  /* !diff + */
  width: 200px;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-basis: 300px;
}
```

<br />

<FlexBasisThird />

<br />

Unlike the `flex-grow` cases, this time **One** element took a little bit longer space than others because `flex-basis` is given to `300px`.

### Resizing flex child elements equally

What if we would like to ignore the initial size of child flex elements and make it all equally same?
In this case, you can give `0` value to `flex-basis`.
What this will do is to tell browser to divide sizes of child flex elements equally based on the total parent flex container.

<br />

```css
.box {
  display: flex;
  height: 60px;
  /* !diff - */
  width: 200px;
  /* !diff - */
  flex-grow: 1;
  /* !diff + */
  flex-basis: 0;
}

.box:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: orange;
  /* !diff - */
  flex-basis: 300px;
}
```

<br />

<FlexBasisFourth />

<center>Before: Only using `flex-grow` `1`</center>

<br />

<FlexBasisFifth />

<center>
  After: Combining both `flex-grow` of `1` and `flex-basis` of `0`
</center>

As you can compare two different cases, when we applied only `flex-grow` of `1` to all `.box` elements,
each child flex elements will take up free empty spaces but with different proportion of its contents (_Before_).
However, if we applied `flex-basis` of `0` altogether, child flex elements now began to have equal widths based on the parent flex container.
